# Networked Virtual Controller

Play local only couch co-op games with just one keyboard/ through the internet.

Games like Cuphead and the LEGO games are local multiplayer only.

Use this to remove that limitation.

This program sends controller inputs either to itself, to simulate a controller with your keyboard, or to a different computer.

You will need a screensharing application like Skype/ Discord/ Twitch.

Usage:
- Configure based on README.txt (not README.md)
- Compile/ Download Realease
- Follow instructions given by program (If you are using Hamachi, or any other tunneling service, use the IP the service gives you)

Features:
- Virtual Generic Controller
- Virtual Xbox Controller
- Simulated Direct Input
